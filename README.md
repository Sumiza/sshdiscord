# ssh login notify
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumiza/sshdiscord/main/install.sh)
```
A simple little script that adds onto the .bashrc file.

When a login happens it will get the information of who is logging in ( with additional information from ipinfo.io ) and send it to a discord webhook to notify you.

I just use it as an extra bit of peace of mind that if a login happens I will get notified right away.
